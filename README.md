# GPDLG
## Note: you will still have to download the games before using GPDLG as I dont own the rights to any of Xbox's licenced games

## What is gpdlg?
Gpdlg is a tool that can be used to free up space for xbox games(both bought and game pass) gpdlg was made because of the massive difference in download sizes with different apps(primaraly Steam and Xbox pc).
Xbox pc downloades every language for the game unlike steam which can bloute the game and sometimes add a extra 20gb to the game.
